## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering
Networking connection **between 2 VPCs that enables one to route traffic between them using private IP addresses**.
Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. 
One can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. 
The VPCs can be in different Regions also known as an **inter-Region** VPC peering connection.
