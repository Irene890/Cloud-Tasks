Amazon Lifecycle Manager 
--Provides a simple, automated way to back up data stored on Amazon EBS volumes.
Benefits
1) Automated snapshot and AMI creation
2) Fast snapshot restore integration
3) Built-in cross-Region copy- Automatically copy snapshots that are created by a lifecycle policy to up to three AWS Regions.
4) Automated cross-account snapshot copy

Automating EBS Snapshots Using Life Cycle Manager
STEPS:
1) Launch an EC2 instance with an attached EBS volume
2) Create Lifecycle policy within DLM
3) Schedule / Enable Cross-Region replication of the EBS snapshot

STEP 1 EXPLAINED::: Launch an EC2 instance with an attached EBS volume
-Log in to your free tier AWS A/C
- Launch instance, name of instanceEC2DLMInstance, Amazon Linux OS (Free tier),
Instance type-t2.micro (Free tier)
-Proceed without key pair
-Configure storage--Add new volume--10 Gig gp3
Launch Instance, wait for it to set up
- Add tag to the 10 Gig volume under EBS-Volumes--name it:EBSDLMVolume

STEP 2 -Create Lifecycle policy within Lifecyle Manager
-Under EBS, select LifeCycle Manager
-Create EBS snapshot policy, click Next step
-Target Resources: Volume
- Tag Resource Tags: EBSDLMVolume
- Description: EBSDLMVolume
- Use default IAM role that enables: "Create,Delete, Describe,Copy,Modify snapshots,DescribeInstances",DescribeVolumes etc
- Assign Tags: Key:Name Value-DLMPolicy      Key: CreatedBy     Value: Irene
- Policy Status: Enabled ( To immediately start creating snapshots)
- Click Next

STEP 3- Schedule/ Enable Cross-Region replication of the EBS snapshot
Schedules define how often the policy runs and the specific actions that are to be performed.
- Give a name to your schedule. Schedule name:EBS-Daily-Snapshots
- Frequency : Daily
- Every: 24 hours
- Starting at--input the time (09:23)
- Retention Type:Count or age
count: 2 copies

Under Advanced Details:
- Tagging (Specify the tags that are to be applied to snapshots created by this schedule.)- Select Copy Tags from source
- Can also enable Fast snapshot restore
- Enable Cross-Region copy for this schedule--us-east-1
---Select the Target region i.e) us-east-1, to expire in 1 day after creation
- KMS Encryption for snapshot is enabled
REVIEW POLICY then CREATE POLICY

                    EBS SNAPSHOT EVENTS:

Amazon EBS sends events to EventBridge when the following volume events occur:createSnapshot,createSnapshots,copySnapshot and shareSnapshot.












.Delete snapshots in both regions.
.Delete the Lifecycle manager.
.Terminate EC2 instance.
