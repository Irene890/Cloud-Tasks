## Configuring High Availability in Your Amazon VPC
*AWS* provides services and infrastruvture to build *reliable*, *fault-tolerant* and *highly available* systems in the cloud.
Fault tolerance is a system's availability to remain in operation even if some of the components in that system fail.
While high availability is the ability of the system to recover quickly from system failure.
Architects must prioritize high availability and fault tolerance in their system designs.
