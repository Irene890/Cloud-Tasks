# Configuring Static Website With S3 And CloudFront
1) Configured static website hosting on Amazon S3
2) Configured static websites to work with CloudFront distributions

- We will host the static website using the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) so that it is secure, fast, protected against data loss, and can scale to support enterprise-level traffic.
- We will also use S3 to deliver the website content to visitors
- We will use Amazon CloudFront to create a content delivery network (CDN).
- A CDN makes the website content available from data centers around the world, called edge locations.
- Edge locations improves the speed of your website by reducing latencies
