SCENARIO
In this hands-on lab, we will create a VPC endpoint and an S3 bucket to illustrate the benefits available for our cloud implementations. 
VPC endpoints can be used instead of NAT gateways to provide access to AWS resources. 
Many customers have legitimate privacy and security concerns about sending and receiving data across the public internet. 
VPC endpoints for S3 can alleviate these challenges by using the private IP address of an instance to access S3 with no exposure to the public internet.

1) Create an S3 Bucket
2) Create a VPC Endpoint
3) Verify VPC Endpoint Access to S3
Log in to the terminal provided for the lab using the Cloud Server of Public Instance credentials provided in the lab resources:
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
In the same terminal, log in using the Cloud Server of Private Instance credentials provided in the lab resources:
ssh cloud_user@<PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>
View the S3 bucket: Command is
aws s3 ls
You should see two S3 buckets â€” the one provided for the lab and the one you created.
