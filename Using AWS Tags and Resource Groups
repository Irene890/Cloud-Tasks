A company runs many applications in a shared AWS account with hundreds of instances. 
The application and security teams want an easy way to find resources associated with a particular application. 
AWS tags and resource groups make it easy to identify application components.

-To simplify the management of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, you can assign metadata using tags. 
Resource groups can then use these tags to automate tasks on large numbers of resources at one time. 
They serve as a unique identifier for custom automation, to break out cost reporting by department and much more. 
In this hands-on lab, we will explore tag restrictions and best practices for tagging strategies. 
We will also get experience with the Tag Editor, AWS resource group basics, and leveraging automation through the use of tags.

2) Create an AMI from an already configured EC2 instance. Right-click on the name of the selected instance, and select Actions > Image and templates > Create image.

4) Tag Applications with the Tag Editor
