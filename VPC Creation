Creating a VPC in AWS

In this hands-on lab scenario, youâ€™re a cloud network engineer tasked with setting up the security and network architecture for your organization's production environment. 
You're tasked to create a virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs), routes, and an internet gateway, as well as adding security using 
security groups and network access control lists (NACLs). 

a) Create a VPC with Cidr block of 10.0.0.0/16
b) Create a public and private subnet in different AZs.
- Public subnet cidr block 10.0.1.0/24
- Private subnet cifr block 10.0.2.0/24
c) Create Routes and IGW
- Enable Auto assign ipv4 for the public subnet.
- Create IGW and attach the vpc
- Create a public Route table and select the created VPC.
- On the public route table, edit routes and in destination, type 0.0.0.0/0...target select the IGW created before.
- Associate the Public Route Table with the Public Subnet

d) Launch EC2 instances in both subnets
- In public subnet, create a SG to allow SSH on port 22
