Creating a VPC in AWS

In this hands-on lab scenario, youâ€™re a cloud network engineer tasked with setting up the security and network architecture for your organization's production environment. 
You're tasked to create a virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs), routes, and an internet gateway, as well as adding security using 
security groups and network access control lists (NACLs). 

a) Create a VPC with Cidr block of 10.0.0.0/16
b) Create a public and private subnet in different AZs.
- Public subnet cidr block 10.0.1.0/24
- Private subnet cifr block 10.0.2.0/24
c) Create Routes and IGW
- Auto assign ipv4 for instances launched in public subnet
- Create IGW and attach the vpc
d) Launch EC2 instances in both subnets
- In public subnet, create a SG to allow SSH on port 22
