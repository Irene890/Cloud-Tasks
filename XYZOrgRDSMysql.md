It's a managed database option for MySQL, Maria, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and MySQL-compatible Aurora. -Best for structured, relational data store needs. -Offers automanted backups and patching in customer-defined maintenance windows.
A **DB engine** is the specific relational database software that runs on your DB instance.
Amazon RDS supports the following engines:MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL

##### Amazon RDS Read Replica:
Purpose:Read replicas are used to offload read operations from the primary DB instance, improving overall performance.
They can also be used to enhance availability by promoting a read replica to the primary if needed.

##### Amazon RDS Snapshot:
Purpose: Backup and Recovery: Snapshots are primarily used for creating backups of your DB instance.
Point-in-Time Restore: They allow you to restore your database to a specific point in time.
